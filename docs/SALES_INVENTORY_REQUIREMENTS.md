# Sales & Inventory Planning requirements

## Forecast Archive Mock Data

- Forecast Archive is read only and continues to receive snapshots during
  Month Closing.
- The initial Mock Data includes May and June archive snapshots for July and
  August forecasts so the archive visualization is available on every preview
  origin before the first local Month Closing.
- Existing non-empty browser-local archive data is preserved. The initial
  snapshots are used only when the saved archive is missing or empty.
- This seed does not change the current planning month, Planning data, History,
  Month Closing state, or any module outside Sales & Inventory.
